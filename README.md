# Chingu-Prework-Project-Book-Finder

**Summary**
This project is basically a book finder. We need to integrate it with the Google Books API. The Purpose of this project is to make API calls and dealing with edge cases.

**Used Resources**
HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

**Requirements from Chingu**
-Enter a query in a search box

-Display a list of books matching the given query.

-Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.

-From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
